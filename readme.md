# Soarchain
**Soarchain** is multi-purpose Layer 1 network that enables a token-incentivized data and connectivity infrastructure for mobility.
â€‹Soarchain is a global, distributed network that create a public data infrasturcture and connectivity layer for mobility members. 
Car miners - MOTUS - produce and are compensated in $MOTUS, the native cryptocurrency of the Soarchain blockchain. The Soarchain blockchain is a new, open source, public blockchain created entirely to incentivize the creation of physical, decentralized mobility network.

*Soarchain* is:
* Appchain, a single purpose blockchain designed for mobility.
* Interchain for Mobility, interoperable with other chains due to the Cosmos SDK.
* Gateway of Web3 for Mobility that brings existing Web3 applications to vehicles and mobility space.
* Infrastructure Independent with direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication.
